# Nion-Swift-batch-editing
Batch editing of data items in Nion Swift .nsproj files

This tool adjusts the data range settings (black point/minimum, white point/maximum, what you adjust by clicking the histogram) for all data items to the same value. Supply it with a Nion Swift .nsproj file and get a replacement for that file as output.
